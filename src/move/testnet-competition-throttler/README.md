# Testnet competition throttler

This Move package defines a throttler for the Econia testnet trading competition.

It provides public functions that can be added to Econia and to the Econia faucet through an on-chain upgrade, then reverted with a subsequent on-chain upgrade.

## Applicability

- Throttling only applies to `THROTTLED_MARKET_ID`.
- Throttling does not apply to exempt accounts.
- Throttling only applies when the throttler is active.
- An admin has exclusive permission to deactivate/reactivate the throttler, and to add/remove accounts from the exempt accounts list.

## Minting
