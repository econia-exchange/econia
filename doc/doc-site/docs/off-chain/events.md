# Events

## Registry events

Econia emits two types of registry events:

| Event                       | Event handle          | Field name                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [`MarketRegistrationEvent`] | [`Registry`]          | `market_registration_events` |
| [`RecognizedMarketEvent`]   | [`RecognizedMarkets`] | `recognized_market_events`   |

Event handles for registry events are created via the `@econia` package account, and are stored as fields in `key`-able resources stored under the `@econia` account.
Hence they can be easily queried via the Aptos node [events by event handle API].

## Market events

Market events were recently incorporated per [#321] and will soon be deployed under a mainnet contract upgrade, pending an audit.

Stand by for more docs, coming soon!
